## Mission Statement

We're building a platform that drives continuous improvement into a company's software delivery efforts. 

Consequently, our mission is simple: **Help companies build better software**.

## Our Values

Our values are simple and straight-forward, liberally taken from @Jeff and @Nolan's previous venture which worked out [nicely](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/17/axway-acquires-mobile-app-development-platform-appcelerator/)).

1. **Humility** - Stay humble as there is always room to grow.
2. **Continuous Improvement** - Measure, iterate, and execute. "You can't improve what you don't measure." - [Jeff](https://www.recode.net/2016/8/5/12377644/technology-startup-investment-advice-scale-slower)
3. **Customer Success** - This value drives everything we do: Help our customer succeed. Consequently, we succeed when our customer's do.
